# Django PrimeTrade Comprehensive Audit - October 31, 2025

**Audit Type:** Comprehensive (Option D)  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (~26/60)  
**Protocol:** 70% test coverage target, three-perspective review  
**Location:** /Users/cerion/Projects/django-primetrade  
**GitHub:** CBRT513 organization

---

## Context

This Django application handles Bill of Lading (BOL) creation, release management, customer/carrier/product master data, and audit logging for a small logistics company (6-8 users max). Built outside Mission Control framework - this is first comprehensive validation against barge2rail.com standards.

**Key Features (per STATUS.md):**
- Release intake/approval with PDF parsing
- Load-driven BOL creation with PDF generation
- Customer/Ship-To/Carrier/Lot/Product master data management
- Audit logging with optional Galactica forwarding
- SSO authentication integration
- Performance indexes in place

**Hot Issues to Address:**
1. Product edit via POST returns "Bad Request/already exists" when updating start_tons
2. Migration warnings: "models have changes not reflected in a migration"
3. UI requests removed /api/branding endpoint (404s)

---

## Audit Objectives

Execute comprehensive review covering:
1. **Security Review** - Authentication, authorization, data validation, secrets management
2. **Code Quality Review** - Conventions compliance, complexity, documentation
3. **Data Safety Review** - Atomic operations, integrity, rollback capability
4. **Structure Review** - Project organization, settings management, naming
5. **Testing Review** - Coverage assessment, critical paths, edge cases
6. **Operational Review** - Hot issues, migrations, deployment readiness

## Audit Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
cd /Users/cerion/Projects/django-primetrade
source venv/bin/activate  # If venv exists
python --version  # Should be 3.11+
```

### Step 2: Install Audit Tools
```bash
pip install radon pytest pytest-cov pytest-django bandit
```

### Step 3: Run Automated Checks

**Complexity Analysis:**
```bash
radon cc . -a -nb --total-average
radon mi . -nb
```

**Security Scan:**
```bash
bandit -r . -x ./venv,./tests
```

**Test Coverage:**
```bash
pytest --cov=bol_system --cov=primetrade_project \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  --cov-report=html
```

**Code Style:**
```bash
flake8 . --max-line-length=100 --exclude=venv,migrations
```

### Step 4: Manual Code Review

Review each file in:
- `bol_system/` (models, views, serializers, etc.)
- `primetrade_project/` (settings, urls)
- `templates/` (XSS risks)
- `static/js/` (API calls, auth)

Focus areas:
1. Security (authentication, input validation, secrets)
2. Conventions (naming, docstrings, complexity)
3. Data safety (transactions, FKs, audit)
4. Hot issues (product edit, migrations, /api/branding)

### Step 5: Generate Report

Create `/Users/cerion/Projects/django-primetrade/AUDIT_REPORT_2025-10-31.md`

**Report Structure:**
```markdown
